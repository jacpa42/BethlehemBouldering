# BethlehemBouldering

A simple guide to bouldering on my farm.

## Background and Info

Iben asked me to make this for anyone interested in bouldering at my farm. This should help anyone who aspires to that goal.

As the boulder sits in [Bethlehem Plaas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TPZWeMC4AntFpdBFA), opening hours vary. However, when the farm is open you are free to walk in to the boulder without my knowledge. If you want to get *car access*, please contact me at <jacobenthoven@gmail.com>. More in depth access information is contained below.

## Access and Location

Here is the [precise location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9GXsPRcMXdio4FMZ6) of the boulder. The standard route to get there by foot is shown below (for car access please contact me).

## Routes

Here are all the sides of the boulders and their routes. The star ratings are out of ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê and *ss* means sit start.

### Left Side

#### 1. Dark Side 6a (Jacob) *ss* ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

A nice warmup. Start on obvious jug with bad feet and traverse around the corner on underclings. Spicy finish!

#### 2. Font 6b 7a (Jeremy) *ss* ‚≠ê‚≠ê

Start as for Dark Side. Do a hard move to a crimp and mantel out right.

#### 3. Golden Boy 7b+ (Dom) ‚≠ê‚≠ê

Morpho! Stand up on bad undercling and find the hold.

#### 4. There is a spoon **project** ‚≠ê

Jeremy has gotten close. Bad gaston in the overhang is the only hope. Start on the ledge.

#### 5. Ladyboy 7b (Jacob) *ss* ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

The best climb on the bloc! Sit start on the jug and climb straight up. Big committing move of a bad crimp to finish.

#### 6. Ladyboy left 7a (Jacob) ‚≠ê‚≠ê

An easier version of lady boy. Start on the ledge and traverse right until you can finish as ladyboy.

#### 7. Paddaman left 7c+ (Ben) ‚≠ê‚≠ê

An easier version of Paddaman Start as Ladyboy left and traverse right to finish as Paddaman.

#### 8. Paddaman 7c+ (Ben) *ss* ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

The üëë line! Start as Ladyboy and break into the middle of the face of the crimp. Finish straight up off a large move on the slopey gaston.

### Main Face

#### 9. Paddawan 7c (Jacob) *ss* ‚≠ê

Climb as Paddaman until the final move and exit onto the right arete via thin holds and high heel. Easier but more committing than Paddaman.

#### 10. Full Frontal 7c (Ben) *ss* ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Start as Ladybug and pull into Paddaman via a large jug in the face.

#### 11. Drag 7a (Jacob) *ss* ‚≠ê

Start as Ladyboy and finish as Ladybug via the large jug in the face.

#### 12. Ladybug 6c (Jacob) *ss* ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Dyno out to the sloper in the face and follow the seam right.

#### 13. The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma 7a (Jacob) *ss* ‚≠ê

The first climb done on the bloc. Do a big move out left and finish on the right side of the boulder via some fun compression.

### Right Side

#### 14. Dogshit 7b *ss* (Jacob)

Truly unremarkable. Only look at this once you have done everything else.
