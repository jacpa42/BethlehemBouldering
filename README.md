# BethlehemBouldering

A simple guide to bouldering on my farm.

## Background and info

Iben asked me to make this for anyone interested in bouldering at our farm. This should serve that purpose. The lines are listed below. The boulder was discovered in 2022 and was properly developed in 2024.

As the boulder sits in [Bethlehem Plaas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TPZWeMC4AntFpdBFA), opening hours vary. If you want to get access, please contact myself at <jacobenthoven@gmail.com>.
